	abstract = {In this paper we present the LegoPress, a simple and cost-effective robotic device intended to be used for leg-press movements in rehabilitation and training. Basic adjustments can be done on the sitting position so as to maximize comfort and adapt the posture of the user depending on the desired training. The LegoPress has two motorized axes independently acting on the two legs. By means of force sensors positioned at the pedal level, a precise monitoring is possible. The force sensor is as well used to improve the impedance control, which enables to reproduce various behaviors. The device is not only able to mobilize the user’s legs but also to interact with her/him.},

	abstract = {Muscles are usually stimulated by shocks delivered at some constant rate. However, human thenar motor units generate optimum force per pulse when excited by impulse trains that begin with one or two short interpulse intervals ("doublets"), followed by longer intervals. Our aim was to determine whether the rate of force and force-time integral reduction during fatigue of thenar muscles is influenced by an initial doublet, and/or the number of pulses per train. We first matched thenar force-time integral using two different pulse patterns, one of which began with a doublet. Fatigue induced by trains that contained a doublet resulted in slower rates of force and force-time integral reduction and smaller increases in half-relaxation time than that evoked by bursts of 40-HZ stimulation. When the force was measured in each protocol after equal numbers of pulses had been delivered, the force loss was still significantly less for pulse trains containing a doublet. These results have useful implications when designing stimulation to strengthen weak muscles or to drive paralyzed muscles.},

	abstract = {This thesis is the first to be carried out within the framework of the project "Cyberthosis for Paraplegics" in progress at the "Laboratoire de Systèmes Robotiques" (LSRO) of the "Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne" (EPFL). This project, initiated in 1999 by the "Fondation Suisse pour les Cyberthèses" in Villeneuve (FSC), is based on the reflections on the current means of physical rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries people. Eager to bring new methods of rehabilitation, the FSC initiated a program focused on the development of rehabilitation devices and overground walking assistance devices, associating an orthotic system with the electrical muscle stimulation. The main objective is to create an active muscular participation while preserving the physiological dynamic effects of the movements and thus to accelerate the process of rehabilitation. Three developments corresponding to three successive phases of rehabilitation are envisaged. A. MotionMaker™: stationary system for mobilization and muscular reinforcement. B. WalkTrainer™: mobile equipment allowing overground locomotion to stimulate neural plasticity and relearn walking. C. WalkMaker™: Assistance device for autonomous walking. The first stage of this thesis was to validate, on the knee joint, the closed loop control of electrically stimulated muscles with the information provided by an orthotic system. To do this, a robotic knee was designed. An electric motor controls the knee bending/extension, with resistance or assistance to the movement. Integrated sensors transmit, in real time, the values torques and articular positions to the dataprocessing programs which control the orthosis and the associated stimulator. This allows the adjustment of the resistance during movement and the adjustment of the electrical stimulation of the quadriceps muscles according to the kinematics and dynamics chosen. With this prototype we demonstrated the feasibility of closed loop control of electrically-stimulated muscles on able-bodied people as well as on people with spinal cord injuries. In a second stage, a more complete device, the MotionMaker™, was developed. It comprises two orthoses for the lower limbs. In the current state, the control unit allows the management of the 3 articulations (hip, knee and ankle) and of 7 muscles on each side (rectus femoris, vastus medialis and lateralis, gluteus maximus, semimembranosus and semitendinosus, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius). Several algorithms of electrical stimulation control were proposed and evaluated in this thesis. They are either based on a mathematical model of the 7 muscles according to the stimulation current and the joint positions or on an iterative learning control. The development of this cyberthosis is currently sufficiently advanced to carry out, on able-bodied subjects, leg-press movements with control of the strength provided by the electrically-stimulated muscles. Thus the outcome push forces on the feet follow the values defined for the exercise. This work is focused on the movement of both above mentioned devices and on the model and the control of the electrical muscle stimulation. The mechanical parts have not been designed by the author.},

	abstract = {Background: This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of functional electrical stimulation (FES) on gait characteristics in healthy individuals. Methods: Six electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Epistemonikos, PEDro, COCHRANE Library, and Scopus) were searched for studies evaluating the effects of FES on spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters in healthy individuals. Two examiners evaluated the eligibility and quality of the included studies using the PEDro scale. Results: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings from the literature reveal that FES can be used to modify lower-limb joint kinematics, i.e., to increase or reduce the range of motion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. In addition, FES can be used to alter kinetics parameters, including ground reaction forces, center of pressure trajectory, or knee joint reaction force. As a consequence of these kinetics and kinematics changes, FES can lead to changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters, such as gait speed, step cadence, and stance duration. Conclusions: The findings of this review improve our understanding of the effects of FES on gait biomechanics in healthy individuals and highlight the potential of this technology as a training or assistive solution for improving gait performance in this population.},

	abstract = {Functional electrical stimulation is a technique to produce functional movements after paralysis. Electrical discharges are applied to a person’s muscles making them contract in a sequence that allows performing tasks such as grasping a key, holding a toothbrush, standing, and walking. The technology was developed in the sixties, during which initial clinical use started, emphasizing its potential as an assistive device. Since then, functional electrical stimulation has evolved into an important therapeutic intervention that clinicians can use to help individuals who have had a stroke or a spinal cord injury regain their ability to stand, walk, reach, and grasp. With an expected growth in the aging population, it is likely that this technology will undergo important changes to increase its efficacy as well as its widespread adoption. We present here a series of functional electrical stimulation systems to illustrate the fundamentals of the technology and its applications. Most of the concepts continue to be in use today by modern day devices. A brief description of the potential future of the technology is presented, including its integration with brain–computer interfaces and wearable (garment) technology.},

Our systematic review of 17 studies reveals the growing interest and potential of EMS in this domain, as evidenced by the growing body of literature and citations. The key elements presented in our review encompass a catalog of the applications developed to date, the specifics of the stimulation parameters used, the participant demographics of the studies, and the types of measures used in these research efforts. We discovered that EMS offers a versatile range of applications in AR/VR, from simulating physical interactions like touching virtual walls or objects to replicating the sensation of weight and impact. Notably, EMS has shown effectiveness in areas such as object handling and musical rhythm learning, indicating its broader potential beyond conventional haptic feedback mechanisms. However, our review also highlights major challenges in the research, such as inconsistent reporting of EMS parameters and a lack of diversity in study participants. These issues underscore the need for improved reporting standards and more inclusive research approaches to ensure wider applicability and reproducibility of results.},

	abstract = {Muscle force was studied as a function of stimulus parameters, epimysial electrode position relative to nerve supply, and muscle length to provide insight into the properties of motor prostheses that employ epimysial electrodes. The results of the acute experiments indicated that the dependence of recruitment (force versus stimulus amplitude) on muscle length was minimal for a monopolar electrode positioned close to nerve entrance or 5 mm proximal to the motor point. The selectivity of stimulation (minimal activation of adjacent muscles) was best, and the recruitment rate the highest, for an electrode placed close to the nerve entrance. A bipolar pair of electrodes placed on the superficial surface of the muscle opposite to the nerve entrance gave better selectivity than the monopolar electrode at the low end of the recruitment range, and poorer selectivity at the high end. This electrode configuration required greater stimulus currents and exhibited a lower recruitment gain than was obtained for a monopolar electrode in the same position. Examination of tissue surrounding the electrode 30 days after implantation showed that the fibrous tissue encapsulating the electrode had been incorporated into the fascial layer. Slightly larger dependence on muscle length and lower selectivity of stimulation were measured after encapsulation than were measured in the acute experiments.},

	abstract = {Electromyostimulation (EMS) incorporates the use of electrical current to activate skeletal muscle and facilitate contraction. It is commonly used in clinical settings to mimic voluntary contractions and enhance the rehabilitation of human skeletal muscles. Although the beneficial effects of EMS are widely accepted, discrepancies concerning the specific responses to EMS versus voluntary actions exist. The unique effects of EMS have been attributed to several mechanisms, most notably a reversal of the recruitment pattern typically associated with voluntary muscle activation. This perspective outlines the authors' contention that electrical stimulation recruits motor units in a nonselective, spatially fixed, and temporally synchronous pattern. Furthermore, it synthesizes the evidence that supports the contention that this recruitment pattern contributes to increased muscle fatigue when compared with voluntary actions. The authors believe the majority of evidence suggests that EMS-induced motor unit recruitment is nonselective and that muscle fibers are recruited without obvious sequencing related to fiber types.},

Some of these neuroprostheses have become commercialized products, and others are available in clinical research settings.
