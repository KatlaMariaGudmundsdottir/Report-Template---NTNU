	abstract = {The knee flexion angle is an important measurement for studies of the human gait. Running is a common activity with a high risk of knee injury. Studying the running gait in realistic situations is challenging because accurate joint angle measurements typically come from optical motion-capture systems constrained to laboratory settings. This study considers the use of shank and thigh inertial sensors within three different filtering algorithms to estimate the knee flexion angle for running without requiring sensor-to-segment mounting assumptions, body measurements, specific calibration poses, or magnetometers. The objective of this study is to determine the knee flexion angle within running applications using accelerometer and gyroscope information only. Data were collected for a single test participant (21-year-old female) at four different treadmill speeds and used to validate the estimation results for three filter variations with respect to a Vicon optical motion-capture system. The knee flexion angle filtering algorithms resulted in root-mean-square errors of approximately three degrees. The results of this study indicate estimation results that are within acceptable limits of five degrees for clinical gait analysis. Specifically, a complementary filter approach is effective for knee flexion angle estimation in running applications.},

	abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation ﬁlter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The ﬁlter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The beneﬁts of the ﬁlter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each ﬁlter update, (2) eﬀective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters deﬁned by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the ﬁlter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

We employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives to verify the conditions under which the nonlinear system that describes the process of motion tracking by the IMU is observable, namely it may provide sufficient information for performing the estimation task with bounded estimation errors. The observability conditions are that the magnetic field, perturbed by first-order Gauss-Markov magnetic variations, and the gravity vector are not collinear and that the IMU is subject to some angular motions. Computer simulations and experimental testing are presented to evaluate the algorithm performance, including when the observability conditions are critical.},

Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles. Therefore, we focus on methods that avoid assuming certain orientations in which the sensors are mounted with respect to the body segments. After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1° on the prosthesis and about 3° on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1°.},

However, human thenar motor units generate optimum force per pulse when excited by impulse trains that begin with one or two short interpulse intervals ("doublets"), followed by longer intervals. Our aim was to determine whether the rate of force and force-time integral reduction during fatigue of thenar muscles is influenced by an initial doublet, and/or the number of pulses per train. We first matched thenar force-time integral using two different pulse patterns, one of which began with a doublet. Fatigue induced by trains that contained a doublet resulted in slower rates of force and force-time integral reduction and smaller increases in half-relaxation time than that evoked by bursts of 40-HZ stimulation. When the force was measured in each protocol after equal numbers of pulses had been delivered, the force loss was still significantly less for pulse trains containing a doublet. These results have useful implications when designing stimulation to strengthen weak muscles or to drive paralyzed muscles.},

	abstract = {This thesis is the first to be carried out within the framework of the project "Cyberthosis for Paraplegics" in progress at the "Laboratoire de Systèmes Robotiques" (LSRO) of the "Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne" (EPFL). This project, initiated in 1999 by the "Fondation Suisse pour les Cyberthèses" in Villeneuve (FSC), is based on the reflections on the current means of physical rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries people. Eager to bring new methods of rehabilitation, the FSC initiated a program focused on the development of rehabilitation devices and overground walking assistance devices, associating an orthotic system with the electrical muscle stimulation. The main objective is to create an active muscular participation while preserving the physiological dynamic effects of the movements and thus to accelerate the process of rehabilitation. Three developments corresponding to three successive phases of rehabilitation are envisaged. A. MotionMaker™: stationary system for mobilization and muscular reinforcement. B. WalkTrainer™: mobile equipment allowing overground locomotion to stimulate neural plasticity and relearn walking. C. WalkMaker™: Assistance device for autonomous walking. The first stage of this thesis was to validate, on the knee joint, the closed loop control of electrically stimulated muscles with the information provided by an orthotic system. To do this, a robotic knee was designed. An electric motor controls the knee bending/extension, with resistance or assistance to the movement. Integrated sensors transmit, in real time, the values torques and articular positions to the dataprocessing programs which control the orthosis and the associated stimulator. This allows the adjustment of the resistance during movement and the adjustment of the electrical stimulation of the quadriceps muscles according to the kinematics and dynamics chosen. With this prototype we demonstrated the feasibility of closed loop control of electrically-stimulated muscles on able-bodied people as well as on people with spinal cord injuries. In a second stage, a more complete device, the MotionMaker™, was developed. It comprises two orthoses for the lower limbs. In the current state, the control unit allows the management of the 3 articulations (hip, knee and ankle) and of 7 muscles on each side (rectus femoris, vastus medialis and lateralis, gluteus maximus, semimembranosus and semitendinosus, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius). Several algorithms of electrical stimulation control were proposed and evaluated in this thesis. They are either based on a mathematical model of the 7 muscles according to the stimulation current and the joint positions or on an iterative learning control. The development of this cyberthosis is currently sufficiently advanced to carry out, on able-bodied subjects, leg-press movements with control of the strength provided by the electrically-stimulated muscles. Thus the outcome push forces on the feet follow the values defined for the exercise. This work is focused on the movement of both above mentioned devices and on the model and the control of the electrical muscle stimulation. The mechanical parts have not been designed by the author.},

Methods: Six electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Epistemonikos, PEDro, COCHRANE Library, and Scopus) were searched for studies evaluating the effects of FES on spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters in healthy individuals. Two examiners evaluated the eligibility and quality of the included studies using the PEDro scale. Results: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings from the literature reveal that FES can be used to modify lower-limb joint kinematics, i.e., to increase or reduce the range of motion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. In addition, FES can be used to alter kinetics parameters, including ground reaction forces, center of pressure trajectory, or knee joint reaction force. As a consequence of these kinetics and kinematics changes, FES can lead to changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters, such as gait speed, step cadence, and stance duration. Conclusions: The findings of this review improve our understanding of the effects of FES on gait biomechanics in healthy individuals and highlight the potential of this technology as a training or assistive solution for improving gait performance in this population.},

	abstract = {Functional electrical stimulation is a technique to produce functional movements after paralysis. Electrical discharges are applied to a person’s muscles making them contract in a sequence that allows performing tasks such as grasping a key, holding a toothbrush, standing, and walking. The technology was developed in the sixties, during which initial clinical use started, emphasizing its potential as an assistive device. Since then, functional electrical stimulation has evolved into an important therapeutic intervention that clinicians can use to help individuals who have had a stroke or a spinal cord injury regain their ability to stand, walk, reach, and grasp. With an expected growth in the aging population, it is likely that this technology will undergo important changes to increase its efficacy as well as its widespread adoption. We present here a series of functional electrical stimulation systems to illustrate the fundamentals of the technology and its applications. Most of the concepts continue to be in use today by modern day devices. A brief description of the potential future of the technology is presented, including its integration with brain–computer interfaces and wearable (garment) technology.},

Our systematic review of 17 studies reveals the growing interest and potential of EMS in this domain, as evidenced by the growing body of literature and citations. The key elements presented in our review encompass a catalog of the applications developed to date, the specifics of the stimulation parameters used, the participant demographics of the studies, and the types of measures used in these research efforts. We discovered that EMS offers a versatile range of applications in AR/VR, from simulating physical interactions like touching virtual walls or objects to replicating the sensation of weight and impact. Notably, EMS has shown effectiveness in areas such as object handling and musical rhythm learning, indicating its broader potential beyond conventional haptic feedback mechanisms. However, our review also highlights major challenges in the research, such as inconsistent reporting of EMS parameters and a lack of diversity in study participants. These issues underscore the need for improved reporting standards and more inclusive research approaches to ensure wider applicability and reproducibility of results.},

	abstract = {Muscle force was studied as a function of stimulus parameters, epimysial electrode position relative to nerve supply, and muscle length to provide insight into the properties of motor prostheses that employ epimysial electrodes. The results of the acute experiments indicated that the dependence of recruitment (force versus stimulus amplitude) on muscle length was minimal for a monopolar electrode positioned close to nerve entrance or 5 mm proximal to the motor point. The selectivity of stimulation (minimal activation of adjacent muscles) was best, and the recruitment rate the highest, for an electrode placed close to the nerve entrance. A bipolar pair of electrodes placed on the superficial surface of the muscle opposite to the nerve entrance gave better selectivity than the monopolar electrode at the low end of the recruitment range, and poorer selectivity at the high end. This electrode configuration required greater stimulus currents and exhibited a lower recruitment gain than was obtained for a monopolar electrode in the same position. Examination of tissue surrounding the electrode 30 days after implantation showed that the fibrous tissue encapsulating the electrode had been incorporated into the fascial layer. Slightly larger dependence on muscle length and lower selectivity of stimulation were measured after encapsulation than were measured in the acute experiments.},

	abstract = {Electromyostimulation (EMS) incorporates the use of electrical current to activate skeletal muscle and facilitate contraction. It is commonly used in clinical settings to mimic voluntary contractions and enhance the rehabilitation of human skeletal muscles. Although the beneficial effects of EMS are widely accepted, discrepancies concerning the specific responses to EMS versus voluntary actions exist. The unique effects of EMS have been attributed to several mechanisms, most notably a reversal of the recruitment pattern typically associated with voluntary muscle activation. This perspective outlines the authors' contention that electrical stimulation recruits motor units in a nonselective, spatially fixed, and temporally synchronous pattern. Furthermore, it synthesizes the evidence that supports the contention that this recruitment pattern contributes to increased muscle fatigue when compared with voluntary actions. The authors believe the majority of evidence suggests that EMS-induced motor unit recruitment is nonselective and that muscle fibers are recruited without obvious sequencing related to fiber types.},

When electrically elicited muscle contractions are coordinated in a manner that provides function, the technique is termed functional electrical stimulation (FES). In more than 40 years of FES research, principles for safe stimulation of neuromuscular tissue have been established, and methods for modulating the strength of electrically induced muscle contractions have been discovered. FES systems have been developed for restoring function in the upper extremity, lower extremity, bladder and bowel, and respiratory system. Some of these neuroprostheses have become commercialized products, and others are available in clinical research settings. Technological developments are expected to produce new systems that have no external components, are expandable to multiple applications, are upgradable to new advances, and are controlled by a combination of signals, including biopotential signals from nerve, muscle, and the brain.},
