\subsection{Functional Electrical Stimulation}
Functional Electrical stimulation (FES) is the application of electical current to excitable tissue to supplement or replace a functionthat is lost in neurologically impairecd individuals. FES can e used for chronic applications for resoration of function or in therapeutic applications as it is used in the project. The aim of therapeutic electrical stimulation is to improve tissue health or voluntary function by inducing physiological changes that remain after the stimulation.

FES applications for motor function uses the fundemental principle that electrical stimulation generally activates nerve rather than muscle \cite{peckham_functional_2005}. This is because the threshold charge for directly eliciting muscle fiber action potentials is much gereater than the threshold of producing action potentials in neurons \cite{mortimer_motor_2011}, as shown in
