\section*{Abstract}
Motor impairments caused by hemiparesis, a common consequence of stroke, affect millions of people worldwide. The resulting inability to walk or move independently places a significant physical, emotional, and social burden on patients, driving a strong demand for effective rehabilitation solutions. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), a technique that applies electrical impulses to activate muscles, has shown promise in enhancing motor function, promoting neuroplasticity, and supporting recovery. Despite its potential, most existing FES systems rely on open-loop control, which lacks the adaptability, efficiency, and safety required for optimal rehabilitation outcomes.

This project addresses these limitations by developing a closed-loop FES control system for gait rehabilitation. Leveraging real-time feedback from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and linear stimulation control combined with a feedforward element. This design ensures safer and more efficient gait training by dynamically adjusting stimulation intensity based on deviations from reference joint angles, thereby reducing user burden and minimizing overstimulation.

Key contributions beyond the implementation of the closed-loop control include the the design and validation of an open-loop stimulation sequence, integration of wireless IMUs as well as a sensor fusion algorithm for real-time joint angle estimation. All implemented within a modular and scalable software framework. The system and it's components were systematically validated through testing, demonstrating it's potential to improve stimulation efficiency and thereby rehabilitation outcomes. Thereby laying a robust foundation for further development of closed-loop FES systems and progressing toward clinical applications.
