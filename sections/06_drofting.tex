\subsection{Open Loop Sequence}

\subsection{Knee Angle Extraction}

In the future a different benchmarking technique should be used such as a wireless goniometer or the XSens which was used for validation of the open loop sequence but was regretfullu not available during the period in which the knee angle estimation method needed validation.

\subsection{Closed-Loop}

\todo{explain why using a PD}

discuss that in further iterations it would be interesting to use a reference curve that was averaged acroos multiple subjects in order to make it more generalizable, one could even make specific demographic groups and speed groups such as female young adult or male middle aged, since there is some variation in gait dynamics between demographics, especially related to age and sex and weight
